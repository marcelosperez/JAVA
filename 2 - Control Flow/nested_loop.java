/* 
 
It is also possible to place a loop inside another loop. This is called a nested loop. The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

// Outer loop
for (int i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
System.out.println("Outer: " + i); // Executes 2 times

// Inner loop
for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
System.out.println(" Inner: " + j); // Executes 6 times (2 * 3)
}
}
